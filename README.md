Integrated System of Plans (ISoP)
=================================

A Plone plugin that allows multiple agencies across a region to share common
documents and GIS layers. This document repository can serve as the
authorative source of these documents or simply as a convenient centralized
directory.

The long-term purpose of the repository is to enable meta-analysis of plans
including determining how plans interact.
